Score-based causal discovery methods
================================================
In this section, we would like to introduce Score-based causal discovery methods, including GES and Exact search methods.
For GES, we implemented it with BIC score [1]_ and generalized score [2]_. For Exact search, we implemented DP [3]_ and A* [4]_.
